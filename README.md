- YoY Growth  
- CAGR  
- Top States by Transaction Amount  
- User Device Share (Brand-wise)  
- Year-on-Year Trend (2018–2022)  
- Users vs Transactions Scatter Plot  

### **2️⃣ State-Wise Insights**
- State ATV  
- Multi-Year Growth %  
- State Rank by Amount  
- Transactions per User  
- Quarterly Growth Trend  
- Quarter-wise Transaction Comparison  
- Cumulative Transaction Trend  
- Transaction Breakdown by Type  

### **3️⃣ District Level Analytics**

## 🧮 Key DAX Measures Used

```DAX
Total District Amount = SUM(phonepe_district_master[amount])

Total District Transactions = SUM(phonepe_district_master[trans_counts])

Total District Users = SUM(phonepe_district_master[registered_users])

District ATV = DIVIDE([Total District Amount], [Total District Transactions])

Engagement Score = DIVIDE([Total District Transactions], [Total District Users])
